                boys and girls must be guided on how they can be in a safe side while online,
                 by considering number of things like building a positive online reputation

        </h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
           <strong> Installing menstrual care system in schools:</strong>Program has prepared separate proposal plans, aiming to build special changing rooms in schools, not simply toilets as we have experienced on the grounds rather its full accommodate many supportive facilities including; emergence bed rest-double deca with capacity of taking 15-20 children at once, first aid kits, emergence sanitary pads, 2-washing toilets 1-bath room, 1-changing room within as well as installed incinerator machine outside for burning used pads.<br><br>
           <strong>Training ToT to make re-usable pad:</strong> selection will be done among the students in schools. This will serve two purposes (health safety and economic). Firstly its known some children are coming from under resourced families, many can’t afford purchasing sanitary pads every month to support their girl’s children, alternative is required and far better considering safety as local made reusable pads proven to be safe.<br><br>
<strong>  Awareness raising sessions among the Children and Youth:</strong> This will be done on the practices of Menstrual hygiene by sharing information, initiate menstrual hygiene discussions among girls and boys to learn the challenges and struggle that girls are facing. Also to capacitate teachers to support students as well as empower different peers with the tasks of inspiring others to be self confident, maintaining clearnness and act respectful regardless of environment.<br><br>
This awareness is purposely aiming to strengthening gender role, so that male teachers and boys students can offer their support to young girls instead of creating environment which stigmatize girls and feeling down.

            Growth during adolescence is faster than at any time in child’s life time. Iron requirement also increases dramatically as the result of increase in total blood volume, body muscle.

        <p class="sample-text">
            Emphasis on environmental issues has yet cuptured the minds of many young people, due to the fact that many addressing environment issues separatetly from the LIFE of human being. This  perception itselfs is wrong. What we have used to call environment and human being share a single system. As environment affect our health, we do as the same to the enviroment.  Food we eat, air we breath and all other human needs we depends from the environment but the global practices of human activities can leave the earth better or worse in each day, environment do to us as well. Through this program, apart from helping children and youth changing perceptions but also many will participate in practical activities that will help them to make a good life choices, where from the childhood, they will slowly changing their culture and become better environment protectors/activists in the future.

        </h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            Many people including (youth and children)  believes drugs can cure diseases, but this is  not entirely truth. Drugs can only help the body in its efforts, as all drugs has far reaching chemical effects on the body. Only the body can cure diseases in its origin/natural processes. There is a fine line between correct and incorrect use of drugs. They must be effective, but also be safe, thats why this program needs to capacitate children with relevant knowledge and skills regarding the matter. 
            Also there is a growing number of alcohol, sigarette and marijuana users, who are children and youth both girls and boys. There is a high need of program target group to be informed why some have fallen the risks of excessive use, health effects and strategies for recovery if one is addicted.

            We are all surrounded by millions of microbes living things which are too small  for human eyes to see without the help of microscope. A microscopic zoo lives all around us- on the surfaces we touch, in the air we breath on the food that we lift to our mouth as well as on the surfaces of our body. Most are harmless and perfoms valuable services, However can cause infectious diseases. These microbes known as pathogens. Its important for children to learn how the body defences itself, what action to take to maintain high immunity. The body has many barriers against infectious diseases. If diseases does get past the first barrier, the body can often still fight it off. What are those barriers? Children shall be informed.
Also there is a point of VIRUSES which differ greatly from bacteria, its important to know different forms of viruses and how they can be transmitted, cured and treated as well. Therefore children under FGH programs will be empowered and offered with strategies they can use to protect themselves against infections.
